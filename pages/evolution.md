<!--
- Designers had a blast
- "Carnival" or "Times Square in NYC"
- Pages might look alike, but not a given
- Reinvent the wheel each time

# Style Guide

<!--
- "A button needs to look like this"

### Pros
- More alignment
- Everything started to look alike

### Cons
- Repetition in code
- Many are alike, but not the same
- New branding? Everybody needed to do rework. At the same time
  - Rabobank's "Granite gray"

### Transition
When modularity in FE came around: "We can do better"

# Component Library

<!--
### Pros
- Even more alignment
- Often documented
- (way) less repetition
- Build your UI faster
- Easier to apply rebranding
- (possibly) part of a11y comes out of the box

### Cons
- Often shared effort
    - Tweaks
    - Still comparable (but no equal) components
- Often vendor lock-in
- Only components

### Transition
"This is a good start, but we can still do better"

# Design System

<!--
### Pros
- Full UI building suite
- Fully aligned
- Same UX in all nooks and crannies in your application(s)
    - Brand recognition
- Your design is hard-coded
    - Designers are no longer free to recreate NYC's Times Square

### Cons
- Your org needs to be ready for this
  - Otherwise, designers still tweak
- "Fine! I'll build it my self"
    - Not part of the design system?
    - Not according to brand design?

### Transition
"Before I tell you about DS, let's look at OSS first"

<!--
- Great start

# Cons
- Vendor lock-in
- Stick to their "open-ness"
