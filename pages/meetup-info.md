### Why did we organise this meetup
Remy and I both work on design systems. Love working in a multidisciplinary team. There is no design system without the joined effort in all these roles. About time we learn from each other in a wonderful evening of meeting peers and learning from experience.

**First Round of Talks:**
### The Evolution of Design Systems - Remy Parzinski, Design System Lead at Logius
Design Systems didn't appear out of thin air. I'll take you on a journey from NYC's Times Square to Design Systems using LEGOs.

### Color me surprised! - Robbert Broersma, Design System Lead at NL Design System
Did you know some people see your website completely in their own color scheme? Using a media query for forced-colors and some CSS custom properties, your website will become accessible in interesting new ways.

### Do you mean select or a dropdown? - Tanja van der Heide, User Experience Designer at iO Amsterdam
Common understanding is about more than words. Let's dive into the collaboration between design and development and how we can climb out of pitfalls together.

**Second Round of Talks:**

### Figma API Fun: Lessons Learned in Taming Icon Libraries and Tracking Component Detachments - Thomas Berghaus-Dobber, Design System Engineer (formerly at Adyen)
In my time at Adyen, I actively contributed to projects that extensively utilized the Figma API. These projects were focused on automating the syncing and distribution of icon libraries, and tracking component (mis)usage across the organization. Join me in this talk as I share my learnings and delve into some of the details of their implementation.

### Stay in love with Poncho - Erwin Schaapman, Product Owner Poncho Design System at ANWB
In a corporate organization like ANWB a team that is responsible for its design system faces a variety of challenges. Let's take a tour and meet these challenges and see what we do to make our stakeholders keep loving Poncho the Design System.
